> Problem Statement :   

In today's world, people can easily express their opinions on social media. Therefore, as a company operating in the social media sector, specifically Twitter, we want to identify and classify tweets posted by Twitter users into three categories: neutral, positive, and negative. We aim to do this because it is observed that some people misuse the platform to tweet hateful content __[source](https://news.detik.com/berita/d-2830824/duel-di-depan-istora-senayan-karena-twitwar-ini-klarifikasi-redinparis)__. Twitter is trying to tackle this problem. Hence, we will attempt to create a robust NLP-based classification model to distinguish negative tweets and block such tweets, and if necessary, block the accounts that post these negative tweets.

> Objective :   

The main objective of this project is to develop an NLP-based classification model aimed at predicting neutral, negative, and positive tweets based on the given dataset. The method used will be a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Model evaluation will be conducted using the accuracy metric to determine whether the model is a good fit, underfit, or overfit, which will then facilitate its application for predictive purposes.
